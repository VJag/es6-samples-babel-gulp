Sample to use Babel with Gulp to convert es6 code to es5.

Prerequisite:

Node should have been installed, and the source is pulled into a local directory.

Steps to setup and run:

1. Run npm install in the directory where code is. This should pull all the required dependecies.
2. Run "gulp"

THis will create a dist directory and babel converts es6 code to es5 and creates the es5 equivalent in dist directory.
